I am replying to you directly to confirm:

1.  **I HAVE THE IMAGES.** I am **not** looking for them anymore. They are already in your project.
2.  **I UNDERSTAND YOUR REQUIREMENTS.** Specifically:
    - **Resize**: Only from the bottom-right corner.
    - **Move**: From top/middle/other corners.
    - **Exit**: Drag the bubble to the "X" at the bottom.
    - **Icons**: Use the specific JPEG files you provided.

I am ready to write the code immediately. Please confirm so I can execute.
