STRICT RULES - MUST FOLLOW:
- Plan in EXACTLY 3 bullet points MAX. No revisions.
- After plan, EXECUTE tools immediately: edit code, run tests, read/write Drive files via integration. Do NOT think more or ask questions unless explicitly blocked.
- If no progress in 1-2 minutes or repeat thoughts detected, output "BLOCKED: [short reason]" and STOP. No loops.
- Every 5 steps or after any change: Output "ACTION COMPLETE: [what was done, e.g., 'Edited bot.py line 120, tested polling, Drive folder organized']" and show diff/commit if applicable.
- Prioritize execution over reasoning. Ship changes.

Task: [your thing, e.g., Fix Telegram bot webhook timeout in bot.py from Drive 'Bots' folder, test, then organize files by date.]
Start execution NOW.
