if you notice you're reasoning about the same problem for more than 3 iterations:

1. STOP reasoning
2. Explicitly state: "I'm in a loop about [topic]"
3. Ask the user: "[Specific question] - I need this clarified to move forward"
4. WAIT for response before continuing

EXAMPLE LOOPS TO WATCH FOR:
- "Should I use X approach or Y approach?" (debating without decision)
- "Let me search for this pattern..." (searching same codebase multiple times)
- "This might break Z feature..." (worrying without testing)
- "I could refactor this multiple ways..." (option paralysis)

ESCAPE: Ask user for a decision point.
